# Hackbox Games

Welcome to the new Hackbox Games repository.

Commands:
---------
Run from project root:
- `npm run client` will start the react dev server
- `npm run server` will start the hackboxgames server with hot-reloading
- `npm run dev` starts both react and hackboxgames (with hot-reloading) servers
- `npm start` will start the hackbox server normally
- `npm run deploy` builds a static version of react client files, then starts the hackboxgames server

All `Create React App` commands run normally when executed in the `client/` directory.
